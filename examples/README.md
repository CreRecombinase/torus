We provide two tutorials to guide the users through the use of ```torus``` for QTL discovery. The two tutorials show the usage of two different types of input formats accepted by the current implementation:

1. a generic input format with pre-computed single SNP Bayes factors, demonstrated by the analysis of GUEVADIS data 
2. summary-level statistics organized as the output format of software package [MatrixEQTL](http://www.bios.unc.edu/research/genomic_software/Matrix_eQTL/), demonstrated by the analysis of GTEx liver data

All the input files in the two tutorials are pre-prepared. The users can download the data files following the urls in each tutorial.
